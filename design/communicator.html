    <h2>The Communicator</h2>
      <p>As editor-in-chief of Ann Arbor's nationally awarded scholastic magazine, 
        I led a redesign of the publication. This involved leading a staff of
        over 60, creating templates which were easily understandable, and assisting
        those with less design skill to contribute to a cohesive brand and 
        consistent reader experience. Additionally, I helped lead a move towards
        theme-based editions, each of which had its own aesthetic language and
        addressed specific topics. Under my leadership as design editor and 
        editor-in chief, we were awarded 1st and 2nd place in consecutive years 
        by the National Scholastic Press Association, as well as receiving their
        prestigious

        <h3>Typography</h3>
          <p>For the redesign of the magazine, my main goal was to ensure consistency
            across each page of each issue. With different designers for each article, 
            this meant strict typography guidelines, which would make it easier
            to train staff and compile the magazine. 
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/aktiv-grotesk">Aktiv Grotesk</a>, 
            with its breadth of families, was a sans-serif multitool with a blocky, modern feel. 
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/georgia">Georgia</a>, 
            with its consistent weighting, adherance to readability, and 
            beautiful italics, was an excellent complement to the brutalism of 
            Aktiv.

      <h3>Themes</h3>
      <p>For a magazine, I think that cover design is both a chance to display
        artwork, as well as a way to turn a first impression into curiousity.
        For each themed issue, I was responsible for curating graphic and artistic
        styles, and creating a cover which was tied to the themed section.
      </p>
      
      <img class="content no-blur zoom-img" style="padding-top:50px" src="/images/communicator/techlayout.png" >
      <p>For the tech edition, I settled on lines of binary code as a graphic motif.
        I used a 3D render of this code wrapping around a smartphone for a
        dramatic, eye-catching cover.</p>
      <img class="content no-blur zoom-img" src="/images/communicator/identitylayout.png">
      <p>For our identity edition, I focused on studio portraits of the subjects 
        as the main visuals. Through this, I felt that we could be more true to
        the people featured, without abstracting their stories. The cover and 
        title page show the multilayered, intersecting nature of identity through
        the use of collage.
      </p>
      <img class="content no-blur zoom-img" src="/images/communicator/gunslayout.png">
      <p>We dedicated an issue to violence during ongoing concerns about gun 
        legislation, local sexual assault policy, and police brutality. One of the
        pieces featured a teacher who hunts in his free time, and who advocates
        for responsible gun ownership. I created a digital silhouette of his gun, 
        a Winchester Model 94, which appeared on the cover with a white padlock, 
        symbolizing the push and pull between safety and freedoms. Additionally,
        I laid out the article with an illustration of a bullet flying from the 
        muzzle of the rifle and piercing through the text.
      </p>
      <img class="content no-blur zoom-img" src="/images/communicator/senioredition1.png">
      <p>For our final issue, we focus on the stories of graduating seniors. However,
        for the class of 2020, graduation was marred by COVID-19, without the opportunity
        to celebrate in person. Although the issue remained celebratory, I wanted 
        to acknowledge the virtual nature of our lives, not pretend it hadn't happened.
        I recreated computer windows to hold the portraits of each senior, and 
        added mouse pointers floating around the pages.
