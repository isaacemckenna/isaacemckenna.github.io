    <h2>Gupta Media</h2>
      <p>During my Summer 2022 internship at Boston-based marketing and creative agency 
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.guptamedia.com/">Gupta Media</a>, 
        I worked closely with the entire creative team on a variety of assignments.
        As a larger project, I was tasked with overhauling the capabilities deck, which
        is often sent to prospective clients in order to set Gupta apart and provide
        a portfolio of work.
      </p>
      <p>I was also limited to Google Slides, as the deck had to be easily modified
        by non-creative staff. Despite the limited toolset available, I knew I wanted
        to break away from the typical static slideshow. I developed motion graphics
        which, in GIF form, provided dynamism to otherwise motionless slides. I 
        also streamlined existing color palettes and fonts. The resulting deck
        and graphic elements are still beign used company-wide in a variety of presentations. </p>

      <h3>The problem</h3>
      <p>The previous iteration of the capabilities deck had compelling content, 
        but as material meant to impress other agencies and possible clients, it
        lacked creative spark. With a dark color scheme and inconsistent layout,
        as well as imagery and graphics that were often busy and unrelated,
        it felt dated and lacked a cohesive visual language. Some of the slides
        just needed some cleaning up, and many needed a complete overhaul. Below 
        are excerpts from the existing deck I was tasked with redesigning.
      </p>

      <h3>Color</h3>
      <p>The first thing I changed during the redesign was the overall color palette.
        Pulling from existing guidelines, I created new gradient styles for headers
        and body slides. I transitioned to a slate gray and bright blue 
        color scheme, moving away from the black, blue, and yellow, which felt 
        too tech-y for a marketing agency. I used a separate dark theme 
        sparingly to place emphasis on certain topics. I also digitized the 
        logos of partner companies and kept their coloring consistent.
      </p>

    <h3>Motion</h3>
      <p>One of the biggest changes I implemented was the introduction of motion,
        which helped the presentation to feel lively. Although Google Slides does
        not natively support motion graphics, I was able to convert animations 
        to GIF format. Paired with native slide transitions used in unique ways,
        this was a massive improvement, creating points of interest throughout 
        which helped to highlight the capabilities and accomplishments of Gupta 
        Media.

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <p>The existing deck used inconsistent fonts, sizes, spacing, and copy
        layout. I streamlined the typography, switching from Questrial to
        Poppins due to its breadth of families,
        and keeping consistency across slides with Helvetica Neue. This
        was also intended to allow media-side staff at Gupta to edit copy without
        disturbing visual coherency.

     <h3>The Results</h3>
     <p>After putting all of these pieces together, the resulting presentation
       received high praise, and was put into use after several iterations. The
       gradients and motion assets I developed are also used across other internal
       and client facing decks. Click through below to view the finished product,
